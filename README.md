## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

**Mobile Movie App** is a fully functional, cross-platform movie discovery app built with **Expo**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript**.  
It integrates **Appwrite** for secure authentication, user data management, and real-time database operations.

The app provides an elegant and intuitive movie-browsing experience — allowing users to explore trending titles, manage collections, track their watch history, and more.

It’s powered by a **custom popularity algorithm** that ranks movies based on user interactions, delivering dynamic and relevant recommendations.

Authentication is handled through **Google OAuth2**, offering a seamless and secure login flow. With features like favorites, collections, watchlist, and live notifications, this app demonstrates both strong UI/UX principles and production-ready scalability.
